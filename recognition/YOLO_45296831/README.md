# Lesion Detect
A YOLO network to detect lesions within the [ISIC 2017/8 data set](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/#2017).
## Task
The ISIC 2017/8 data set contains colour images of over 2000 skin lesions to help AI researchers in discovering techniques to detect melenoma. The task of this report is to use a YOLO object detection network to locate the lesions in these images using segmentation data.
## Model
Image classification models have existed for a long time, with an example like [LeNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeNet) existing since 1990. Object detection is an extension of this, being able to localise multiple objects within an image.
This is what YOLO, you only look once, 
- one-stage detector
- single deep convolutional neural network
- views the entire image in training and testing so it emplicitely encodes contextual information about classes, as well as their appearance.
