# Lesion Detect
A YOLO network to detect lesions within the [ISIC 2017/8 data set](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/#2017).
## Task
The ISIC 2017/8 data set contains colour images of over 2000 skin lesions to help AI researchers in discovering techniques to detect melenoma. The task of this report is to use a YOLO object detection network to locate and classify the lesions in these images.
## Model
- object classifcication
- one-stage detector
- single deep convolutional neural network
- views the entire image in training and testing so it emplicitely encodes contextual information about classes, as well as their appearance.
